The unmodified form has hemolytic activity, the oxidized form lacks hemolytic activity. If the protein is linearized, hemolytic activity is lost.
MOA: a small number of cyclotides bind to the membrane surface and then insert first into the outer membrane leaflet followed by penetration through the membrane and pore formation. At higher concentrations of cyclotides, destabilization of membranes occurs.
Tissue specificity: Leaves and stems. Lower in roots.
Pharmaceutical use: The uteroactive properties of Kalata have been discovered by African traditional medicine. It is used as an ingredient of a herbal tea to accelerate childbirth.
