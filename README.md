STREME Integration (Important Notice)

STREME is part of the MEME Suite, which currently has severe dependency issues on macOS (especially Apple Silicon, ARM64). As a result, the local installation of STREME may fail due to missing Perl, ICU, or OpenMPI builds in the conda ecosystem.

To ensure reproducibility and platform-independent execution, the STREME module of the Motifer pipeline is provided as an external Google Colab notebook.

🔧 How to run STREME (recommended method)
Export the peptide FASTA files generated by the pipeline
(e.g., 9_15aa_peptides.fasta, 15_25aa_peptides.fasta, etc.).

Upload these files to the Colab notebook.

Run the notebook to obtain:

motif logos
position weight matrices (PWM)
p-value statistics
enriched motif reports
This approach guarantees that STREME works identically on all systems (macOS, Windows, Linux) without local installation.
