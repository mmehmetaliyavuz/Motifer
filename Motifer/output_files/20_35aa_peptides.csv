The unmodified form has hemolytic activity, the oxidized form lacks hemolytic activity. If the protein is linearized, hemolytic activity is lost.
MOA: a small number of cyclotides bind to the membrane surface and then insert first into the outer membrane leaflet followed by penetration through the membrane and pore formation. At higher concentrations of cyclotides, destabilization of membranes occurs.
Tissue specificity: Leaves and stems. Lower in roots.

PMAP can bee found in various types.  Function: AM and PAMP are potent hypotensive and vasodilatator agents. Numerous actions have been reported most related to the physiologic control of fluid and electrolyte homeostasis. In the kidney, am is diuretic and natriuretic, and both am and pamp inhibit aldosterone secretion by direct adrenal actions. In pituitary gland, both peptides at physiologically relevant doses inhibit basal ACTH secretion. Both peptides appear to act in brain and pituitary gland to facilitate the loss of plasma volume, actions which complement their hypotensive effects in blood vessels. PAMP can acts as an potent antimicrobial peptide which is more selective than melittin, and antimicrobial action of PAMP seems to exert via an intracellular target.","[Ref.32439180] Gram-negative bacteria: E. coli (MIC = 8 μM), P. aeruginosa (MIC = 32 μM), S. typhimurium (MIC = 16 μM)##Gram-positive bacteria:B. subtilis (MIC = 8 μM), S. epidermidis (MIC = 8 μM), S. aureus(MIC = 16 μM)",[Ref.32439180]HC10 > 256 μM against sheep RBCs.Note: HC10 is the minimum peptide concentration that caused >10% hemolysis of sheep red blood cells.,Linear ,Free,Amidation,,L,Not found,Bacterial DNA,32439180,Biochem Biophys Res Commun. 2020 Jun 30;527(3):744-750. doi: 10.1016/j.bbrc.2020.04.063.
